This dataset contains texts from Greek lullabies originating in various Greek-speaking regions. 
The lullabies are organized into subfolders based on their region of origin. 
Each subfolder contains plain text (.txt) files with the lyrics of the lullabies.

Most of the texts were obtained through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) from printed sources, 
with additional texts sourced from official digital publications and recording booklets.
